Hah. Downloading and installing Git and Sublime Text 2 while I type in gedit on a small ubuntu 11.04 setup on a Windows 8 machine. Yeah, I had a craving to write in the middle of the night. Freaks, my Internet connection is a smartphone on Edge Connection giving download speed of 2.4kBps. Not bad.

Anyways, just felt like documenting what _should_ turn out to be one of the most crucial decisions in my life. Funny thing is that even if it doesn't I'll end up having more experience in life. So number of fucks given remain none. Recently I quit my decent paying, satisfactory 11ish to 8ish kind of job at a hot, gaining popularity level startup. I worked there for 228 days which is one day less than 7 and a half months. Lets round that up to 7 and a half months. I take great pride in the fact that I changed the faces of the 2 key products with whatever skills/knowledge I had and would cherish them for times to come.

Unfortunatly, things didn't work out well for me because of the technologies I was working on and hence, I decided to move on. I wanted to do more with my career in the field I found myself inclined towards which in those moments, happened to be Javascript. One again, I began a job hunt. 

After turning down couple of lucrative offers, getting rejected at couple of hot shot companies, I found this amazing opportunity with an early stage startup which goes by the name [Minewhat](http://www.minewhat.com). I am the kind of guy who likes to make decisions in the heat of the moment and I accepted the challenge of working with this startup. I do not believe in consulting my parents or those senior cousins who have been in the industry for several years because I do not believe in building a god-damn resume which would showcase my several 2 year stints with different companies. I did _inform_ everyone of the switch I was about to make in the career after I signed the papers with both the companies concerned, though.

During this whole process, I have had people who have tried to give their piece of mind. One of the biggest lessons learned is to _stay strong_. Believe in the choices you make and thank the people who help you make them.
