My boss and I were on a walk the other day when he asked me what keeps me going in life, what motivates me when I feel low or don't feel like giving a shit. I said, "I am mostly independent in life. The motivation comes from within. The eagerness to learn awesome things keeps me going. When I make a difference to someone's life by my work, that's the biggest source of motivation". He said, "You still haven't answered what motivates you when you feel low. Moreover, how do you get back up?". The answer was pretty simple for me.

"I get high when I am low". I am doing all things possible I couldn't do leeching over my dad.
