Oh well, it has been a rather long stint with Wordpress. It served me well for 2 full years.  Funny how I used to open the admin panel and a popup used to say "Wordpress 3.x.x is available. Upgrade now". Funny because I would actually start backing up posts, database and everything possible in case anything went wrong and then hit upgrade. Used to be few good moments as it made me feel _up-to-date_. The only thing I didn't ever like was using FTP to push files to the server. There was this fear of screwing up something on hosted space and my site going down (not that that's a big deal). I wasn't aware of Version Control Systems back in college and if an industry experience of 1 year has taught me anything then that has to be using a VCS for any work/personal projects.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll") was the obvious choice since it could be easily integrated with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/ "Github Pages"). Spent a day understanding how Jekyll works from it's docs. Turned out quite simple owing to plenty of already hosted sites on Github for quick reference. Also the idea of writing a blog within Sublime Text felt awesome. Without any further delay, I got the Jekyll server running on my local machine. I was saving money here because I wasn't going to pay for hosting anymore. I don't like saving much. Bought a Personal [TypeKit](http://typekit.com "TypeKit") account. After playing with fonts for couple of days, I settled on using couple of serif fonts for this blog. I am sure I will play more with fonts having _bought_ a font library. Definitely a better investment than some web space, you bet.

After pushing the repo on Github, it took around 15 minutes for Github to generate the static site out of it. A new _A Record_ was added with my domain registrar and we were serving straight out of a [Github repo](https://github.com/aakashlpin/aakashlpin.github.com). Awesomeness! The home page load time has drastically improved. Loading pages after home page don't even take a second. ![Network tab from Chrome Inspector](/images/posts/networktab.png)

I can do away with comments.  My personal blog doesn't attract many comments, anyways. If need be, I can easily outsource that to [Disqus](http://disqus.com/ "Disqus comment framework"). I guess that's it. Another happy Jekyll user.

A big shout out to [@vitobotta](https://twitter.com/vitobotta "Twitter profile Vito Botta") and [@csswizardy](https://twitter.com/csswizardry "Twitter profile of Harry Roberts") for being such great inspirations. Especially, [@vitobotta](https://twitter.com/vitobotta "Twitter profile Vito Botta") for writing a [blog post](http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/) that helped me migrate from Wordpress!
