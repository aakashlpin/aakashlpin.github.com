## _One word of advice : For best site experience please use any webkit based browser like Google Chrome or Safari_



Huff...this took me long!!

This site was on my _"localhost" _for quite a time now. I thought there is no point of keeping it that way, and then I went nuts one day. **_[aakashgoel.com](http://www.aakashgoel.com)_** was available for purchase. Spent one full day researching for a good Domain name Provider. Finally, went for the awesome service provided by fellows at **[domainz.in ](http://www.domainz.in); **Yeah, they did set up  a account for me in seconds. Gave me a 10MB space to host. But no MYSQL!! I didn't want to spend any more money buying _"web space"_. Went to **[byethost.com](http://www.byethost.com) **to get a free account!! :)  and boom here I am today!!

Hopefully, I'll  get enough time to update this site frequently.

Loads of awesome stuff coming up..sorry for the broken links and incomplete stuff right now. Trying to fix that up!

Thanks for visiting and I'm sure sure you'll do that again.

c ya.
