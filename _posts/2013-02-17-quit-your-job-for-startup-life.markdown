Exciting times. 12 days have gone by since I joined a 5 member team at an early stage startup. Working directly with entreprenuers is a completely different experience. The networking takes a boost. I've met a lot of CEOs, CTOs, CXOs of tens of companies in the last few days. I've been part of couple of invite only entreprenuer events. Got a chance to share what I am building with couple of guys from UK startup community. Sharing common interests across countries is amazing. I couldn't have dreamed this had I been working on a regular 9 to 5 job with a well established company.

Lets go through the list because I would like to document meeting each person I inspire to be.

[Joe Gebbia](http://www.twitter.com/jgebbia): Heard this guy speak for an hour in a room packed of entreprenuers sitting right next to his feet at the Yourstory office. Yeah I can be spotted in this snapshot thanks to Yourstory! I [blogged about it](http://blog.minewhat.com/post/42846499263/minewhatjoe) too.

Then happened the Techcrunch meetup in Vivanta by Taj where a chosen few companies from UK pitched in with there products. The idea was for them to partner with Indian market and try to get some funding out of VCs in the panel. The meetup was amazing. I personally got a chance to spend a good 20 minute time with [Nigel Chadwick](http://www.stream-communications.com/our-staff/nigel-chadwick-director.html), the Director at [Stream](http://www.stream-communications.com/). Also got a chance to get introduced to a few iconic figures in the tech industry including [Sriram V Iyer](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sviyer) from United Mobile Apps.

The eSparks event organised by YourStory on the e-Commerce market in India was something we at MineWhat were looking forward to. We got few pamphlets and business cards printed.

We went in full branding and were better in presentation that the whole Yourstory team combined. Here's the proof.

It feels good to be part of the startup community and building from the ground up. Sharing common ideas and networking in events like these is amazing. Looking forward to times to come. Cheers!
