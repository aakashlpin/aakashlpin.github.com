30 years. I have not lived enough to feel what thirty years of consternation mean for people who have seen it all through stagnating times. I can see though what it has led to. Gyrated winds have turned into a tornado.

It is not just about a country but the whole Middle East incarcerated by iniquity, living in gruesome poverty and unemployment. Egypt is one example of emergency law and shrewd leadership where people have gone hardnosed resulting in a massive revolt.

The entire political history of Egypt has been turbulating ever since the british rule ended here. Soon after the demise of the british regime, the country had to egress out of the state of poverty, unemployment and debt. It had to free Suez canal from the clutches of Israel which saw success with the second president NASSER supported by US. He striked fine relations with US and Britain and found their help in building a dam in the region.The victory could not last long as Israelis boiling in the fervent desire of revenge attacked Egyptian air forces and regained the Suez canal. Though global developements were met during his reign but power remained largely in the hands of police and the law.

This fashion of governance fell upon a short break under the sovereignty of SADAT ( third president) who brought about peace inviting constitutional changes. He allowed liberalisation of economy and opened rights to people seeking their advice in various matters. His methods were fresh and progressive. Regrettably the country couldn't welter long under his order as he was assasinated after a short service span of 18 months.

Emergency law that was imposed following Sadat's death and in persistence to date transpires an antidemocratic policy under the regulation of the fourth president Hosni mubarak. Handling the nation mulishly for over three decades Mr Mubarak is yet not tired but the people are. They are tired of the unremitting poverty, hunger, rising prices and lousy unemployment rates. They are tired of the despotic police picking people without a warrant, beating them and in the worst cases like that of Khalid Said murdering them on no account. Police is exculpated of all the charges  as the murder is made to appear like an accident, driving people outraged. As per IHS global insights report Mubarak owns Properties in Paris, Londan, Madrid, Frankfurt and Dubai.  Another media report states that the president owns a wealth of forty to seventy billion US dollars.

Stifling for decades under dictatorial powers Egyptians have eventually grossed out. This new year does not seem Mubarak for Mr. Hosni Mubarak. People have voiced their right and the freedom they deserve. The JANTA  triumphs after a long protest and Hosni's rule has collapsed. But there are other questions to be answered. What will happen next? What effect will this have on the other countries with similar conditions? Will this change situations in USA? Even if Hosni leaves now, Will the political unrest end considering who will be the next president?And the most significant of all  Will peace come to Egypt?
