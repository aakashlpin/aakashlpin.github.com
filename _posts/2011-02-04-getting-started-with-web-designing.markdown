First things first:
Let me help out young impatient minds who have lots of questions regarding web designing

Q. How long will it take to learn web designing? (or, I am a noob.)
A. Depends on the efforts you are ready to put in. I took 2-3 months dedicating 2-3 hours daily.

Q. But I don't know anything about web designing and I need someone to guide me!!
A. Neither did I. I started as a noob too. Internet is the ultimate source to get an informal training on web designing and development. There are plenty out there to help you get started.

Q. Ok. Tell me how do I Â make these awesome looking websites?
A. Hmmm..if you wanna make awesome looking websites then you need to [get started with Adobe Photoshop](http://sixrevisions.com/graphics-design/35-basic-tutorials-to-get-you-started-with-photoshop/). There are infinite number of tutorials available online _FREE_ of cost to learn from. If anything else would do, you can do without it.

Q. Hmmm..fair enough. What languages do I need to learn? (I can be too dumb to code, you know.)
A. Never mind, even if you are total jackass. Web designing is a lot of fun once you get started. There are plenty of _wysiwyg_ (What You See Is What You Get) editors available in the market to just drop stuff on a page and boom the code is written automatically for you. Magic!

Q. Wow! that sounds great!! Tell me more!!
A. I know it does. Coming on a more professional level, you need to learn HTML, CSS, Java-script, jQuery to make a good looking website.

Q. WTF!! are you insane? So much for a freggin website?
A. Ahaan buddy. Hold on. That will let you make good looking static kinda stuff. If you want your website to get content from several websites, you want your visitors to give you feedback, you want to hold polls, you want to write some cool stuff everyday then you need to learn either of PHP/MYSQL or ASP.NET/C# (there are plenty of other options but not much help is available free of cost for them.)

Q. Gosh!! You lost me there. Can we get started again bro? I liked the part where you said WYSIWYG can make good websites.
A. I know it may seem scary to start with. But coming to the point of WYSIWYG editors, nothing is better than [Learning Adobe Dreamweaver](http://adobe.com/devnet/dreamweaver.html). Infact from the CS3 version onwards you can make dynamic content available as well _without writing one single line of code for a website_. That's the power of this software.
This software can write [PHP](http://php.net) for you, make connections to your database in the easiest way possible. You get it, all graphically. I bet it's the best way to get started. There are plenty of tutorials from the giant tutorials website [lynda](http://lynda.com) to [learn making websites with Adobe Dreamweaver](http://lynda.com/home/ViewCourses.aspx?lpk0=270).

Q. That sounds pretty awesome to me. What after I learn Dreamweaver? Am I done with web designing and development and can make awesome websites?
A. Yes and no. Depends on what's good enough for you. If you want to make super cool websites then maybe you'll always be a student. New technology comes every month and change the way we code our websites; making it simpler every single time. It takes years and maybe decades to be a perfect web designer and developer. All depends on your comfort level with technologies mentioned above.

Q. Rightly said, can you give me some links to help me get started?
A. Oh ya, that is exactly why we have been talking so far. Here you go.
