Here is a happening list of some of the must-have extensions in case you want to see the potential of Chrome's extensions ever since [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome) 4.0 has come out of beta. In case you still don't use Google chrome, you are missing out big time on the most popular and probably the fastest browser out there.

Now that you have installed "THE" browser try out the following extensions:



	
  * [StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji): One of the coolest extension I've been using over quite a time now. StayFocusd increases your productivity by limiting the amount of time you can spend per day on surfing time wasting web sites. And yes, it won't let you change settings either, in case you wanted to cheat with the extension. ![StayFocusd Extension Window](/images/posts/stayfocusd.png)

	
  * [DayHiker](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/emambmpgicpidmncfacjkeicobamadod): For Google calendar. Check schedule and tasks from toolbar. Manage content on the fly. Plus soft reminders. A next event tooltip with countdown and reminder badges. Plus a hell lot of exciting features. Make sure you check it out. ![DayHiker Extension Window](/images/posts/dayhiker.png)

	
  * [RemindMe](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dkbeopafgiefnlffkhmkhldcojehlgam): This one lets you set up reminders while browsing and lets you sync between computers. One of the best things it does for you is to add up a new bookmark folder called "RemidMe" which can be synced with Google Chrome's built in feature of backing up bookmarks. So, you never lose your reminders either. Cool, isn't it? ![RemindMe Extension Window](/images/posts/remindme.png)

	
  * [LastPass](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd): It does simply what it says. It'll be the last password that'll you'll ever need to remember. It'll fill up login forms for you. Forget that you'll forget any password any more. People watching you over the top while you fill in your username and password's gonna be screwed. One of the old time favourites. A must-have. ![LastPass Extension Window](/images/posts/lastpass.png)

	
  * [Google Dictionary](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja): In case you were unaware, you had to search Google "define:jerks" to get the meaning of 'jerks'. Now, you have a quicky, double click any word and you get the meaning popped right over the word. No time wasted.For people interested in reading stuff online. Get it now.![Dictionary Preview](/images/posts/dictionary.png)

	
  * [Cricinfo](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ijhlikjoigjegofbedmfmlcfkmhabldh): Lastly one for the cricket season!! In case you are unfortunate like me who can't find a television to watch the match, you can get the latest score right in your browser. Plus latest news customized to your preferences. Gives desktop notifications in case a wicket falls and glows when a news item pops in.![Cricinfo Extension Previes](/images/posts/cricinfo.png)
