## Date: 13th January 2013

Aaron Shwartz committed suicide yesterday. Didn't know about him until last morning, but damn people like him shouldn't kill themselves. Heck, they shouldn't die.

Made me realize time is too short to be not doing anything meaningful in life. You are supposed to bring a difference to the lives of people. I am bored of my current job at Capillary. I am quitting it. Life is to short to be doing shitty work day in, day out.
