The long wait is over and recently I was offered a job at [Kuliza Technologies](http://kuliza.com), Bangalore as an UI Developer. I couldn't have wished for anything better. Happy I am.

The whole process of recruitment was very different from other companies. In fact, this was the only company to visit the campus that actually had a look at the resume to shortlist instead of some stupid aptitude test. After shortlisting 5 people from campus, they gave each one of us a task that was to be submitted in 10 days. I did it in a couple of days and got interviewed soon enough. Everything went smooth and I was offered in a couple of days. Out of those 5, 3 people were finally selected to be Kulizans.

Believe it or not but I was offered to work from the very next day of my offer. Being put on a [project](http://zacloud.kuliza.com) so soon was something I couldn't comprehend. In any case, I loved the work I was given. The team liked the work I submitted and after slight modifications on their end, my work went live.

The [employee reviews](http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kuliza-Technology-Reviews-E307540.htm) have made me super-excited about working there. Looking forward to the _zaLife_ starting January 2012!
