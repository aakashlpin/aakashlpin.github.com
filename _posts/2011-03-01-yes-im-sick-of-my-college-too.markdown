I'm sick of it. My college is in permanent pursuit of expanding it's reach to as many aspiring engineers as possible. Those with mediocre physics, chemistry and mathematical skills can very well find a seat here in my college. Or else all you need to do is produce a demand draft of 20 lacs and you get a seat in the college. Such is the case with such colleges that all they need to do is to put one more bench in the huge classrooms to take up one more student and hence there is no cap on the number of students that can come in. In my year->programme->branch, there are more than 370 students, the guys junior to us have more than 600 batch-mates and the guys junior to them have more than 1000 batch-mates. Something that I saw around the campus notice board read like "mission 10X" , I think they mean ten times the current capacity.



I actually don't have any problems with the increasing number of students (except for that fact that it looks like a fish market every evening), the thing that's eating me up is the degrading quality of faculties that the college is recruiting to maintain the tutor-taught ratio. How dumb can a dumb be? My "Internet and Web Programming" lab faculty cannot differentiate PHP and HTML except that it's given different colours by the IDE. They freggin copy our hand-written code and ask if they can use it for teaching other batches. I bet some of them would get straight ZERO in any English Proficiency test given how they degrade the freggin language to new levels every other day. The best part is that the management is fully aware of the pathetic conditions but the sudden rush of money has made them crazy. Since, I myself am a jack of some programming languages, I am often found jaw-dropping by the level of vagueness these faculties have to offer once you start asking them doubts. Okay, this was the case of several faculties who are actually meant to teach us Internet and Web Programming; Take This: One of the lab in-charge in Internet's lab is a faculty who teaches Complier Design. Rate it now. 



In an another case, my faculty in-charge for a project wants me to make me a website having flash content parsed by XML, have "cool looking" animations using jQuery, "overnight". He would encourage us to copy free stuff from the Internet citing that it would always be better than what we would make eventually. It dis-heartened me when the guy told that he has a website run on Joomla- where in he has used a template that he found free of cost on a website- and he is proud of it. How can one stay original when all the mentor expects is mediocracy. The guy in question is titled a "Professor". Yes - I backed off from this project. No - I don't want certificates for copy-pasting other guy's code. 



Yes, I am indeed sick of it. I'm sick of the mediocracy, of the standards, of the least interested management, of the college. I don't care of the quality control measures they may or may not take in the future, just the sheer bulk of students will make them struggle for campus placements, I'm gonna be out of this mess within an year, good luck every one else.
