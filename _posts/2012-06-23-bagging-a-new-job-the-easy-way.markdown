Loads of great news. I have started working at [Capillary Technologies](http://capillary.co.in), have got a new flat to stay at an awesome place in Bangalore and have got a beer belly (yeah! Bangalore!). Having shifted to Bangalore 6 months back, I am feeling the epicness of staying in the Silicon Valley of India. The start-up culture, the [HasGeek](http://hasgeek.com) Conferences, the love for heavy metal, the feeling of being among the most intellectual crowd in the country (no offence to the Microsoft fellows in Hyderabad!).

So yeah, the easy way of getting a job - Attend [HasGeek](http://hasgeek.com) [conference of your choice](http://metarefresh.in) - [win contest](https://twitter.com/capillarytech/status/195851837738467328) - [get featured](http://blog.capillarytech.com/capillary-css-contest-finds-an-undisputed-winner/) - get multiple Offers. Getting a chance to start the career with one of the most potential Startups in Bangalore is a blessing! Looking forward to surviving few years doing User Interface. Cheers!
