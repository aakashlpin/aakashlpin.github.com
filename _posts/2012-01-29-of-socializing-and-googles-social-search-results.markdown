Google has been criticized enough for not showing the search results from certain social networks (Facebook, Twitter) and  pushing it's own (Google+) to the top. I would say, hide the G+ results as well and we are back with the conventional Internet model we had before social networks. I don't think anyone uses Google to find out what millions of people are having for lunch or the regular rants on how awesome one's day was! <!-- more -->

Smart phones have paved a way that enable anyone to update every minuscule irrelevant one liner with several options of keeping it private, sharing it with a group or public. Facebook for everyone has become a digital dairy, a place where you can keep things between your close friends when you are low and rant out loud to the public when you feel awesome. Photographs today are clicked so that they can be uploaded. Nothing is wrong with that, people just want to have everything consolidated in one place called Facebook. Not only it stores all your photographs for you, but also lets everyone have a look at them and "like" and "comment" on them. Who wants to miss out on that kind of present age fun. Suddenly everyone has become young with the presence of at least three generations online on social networks. Okay, so if that's what you do on social networks, why would I like to search it on Google?

Google search is not meant to bring on those search results. If it were supposed to mine the terabytes of micro blogging data generated every second and everyone's interest is in finding out what people are doing every second, we are doomed. So if finding that info is absolutely necessary, use the [plugin](http://focusontheuser.org/) that would search the social networks. But please, do not "spam" my search results with links to user profiles and social groups when what I am interested is in some Wikipedia links and other useful blogs on Google. Lets for instance take the case study of me buying a new phone. I had to buy a new android phone. To start with, I read the reviews on [engadget](http://www.engadget.com/), [gsmarena](http://www.gsmarena.com/) and several other blogs, taking reviews from friends and colleagues before deciding that I would buy a Samsung Galaxy Note :D . I (or for that matter no-one) would trust a 140 character micro blog like "Yayy! I love my Note." or "Best in-bed-multimedia experience ever!" to buy a new product.

I am happy with Google hiding unnecessary search results as I like to see the web decentralized. The difference between searching and socializing remains.
