Some things in life can never be forgotten, the 16 days course at Nettech was one of them.

I don't care about the course I did over there or what I learned over the period, all I care about is the name Nettech associated with me right now. Yes, it was that special. Maybe I have never done something that interesting in my life or I've had sucker of a teachers in my school and college life (still miserable). But, what Nettech offers you is royalty, such a royal and special feeling that can't be felt by any one else because once you are in that environment you feel that nothing can be better than that and nobody can be tought better than this. As a matter of fact, it's not about teaching either. It's about the environment that's being offered. It's about playing with the nerves of the students. It's about giving hard time to the fellows out there.

Yes, the life at Nettech is hard, it's very hard. People tend to give up soon after the course begins. They think they are not that capable enough to solve the questions that are being  asked in the tests. Yeah, they take tests. Lots and lots of tests. You'll get sick of them. But they won't stop coming. Nettech would haunt you with tests. What's so special about these tests? They say, we love to play with your mind and wreck it apart. Yes the questions are easy, but the test has a special name and special significance: It's called a T-10 test. One has to solve some or one question(s) in 10 minutes. Hold On! One single mistake and all you get is a zero. So scoring is binary, 0 or 10 (hope you had your maths lesson right). And to add to the miseries, there's a huge screen that shows the timer ticking down. One spends half the time looking on the projected time going down. I was hot like a cigarette butt after every test because of the way the test used to happen. But your miseries won't stop here. They have a time at which timer would start daily. And it would start with or without you. They don't give a damn about the students. Come or not, you are losing time buddy. Once I reached 7 minutes late and I had to do it in 3 minutes, yes I got a zero. And these zeros became a habit. After getting 3 straight 10's when I got my first 0, I felt bad. When I got my second 0, I said, "never mind, I can do better". But when I got my third one, I said, "screw you, I don't give a damn". I ended my 0's streak after getting 5 of them in a row. It had become a habit by then.

Am I complaining? No. I never would. Yes, I felt dis-heartened when all this happened, but somewhere I was encouraged by the fact that I was among the lucky few who were fortunate enough to be there and learn it from the masters. What I learned there was NOT the course on Network Administration/ Management/ Ethical hacking/ Linux; but I learned that I have to be a perfectionist and that it must be only death that can stop me from reaching on time. To quote the director/ faculty at Nettech, [Mr Swapan Purkait](mailto:swapan@nettech.in),


> "..If I am 1 sec late for class, you can start my condolence meeting..."


Did that inspire me? Yes. Did I start being on time, No. But I did after I lost my 10 marks because I reached late for the test one day.

I wonder how much I have written (word count:619 till now) without saying one single one word about the course or anything relevant to networking because that's what Nettech is all about. Do they teach you everything? NO. But they'll teach you everything possible in a way, you would never forget.

Not to forget the double meaning dialogues [Santu Sir](http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=1627551596) would throw at us and then beg us to stop laughing, the witty dialogues of [Swapan Sir](http://facebook.com/spurkait), the ever jovial nature of [Swapna Ma'am](http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001132021683) and the perfect management by Sunayana Ma'am. These were probably the best academic days of my life (don't go by the results :P)

A special thanks to Team Nettech for those [wonderful days](https://picasaweb.google.com/photos.nettech/NettechWinterTraining2010) in Kolkata.

P.S I'm not promoting Nettech in any way possible. I'm just an ordinary student who felt indebted enough to the way [Nettech](http://nettech.in) changed my attitude. Am I asking you to take up this course? Yes.
