I never thought I would do that. Giving money under the table was passe, I thought. That happened in yesteryear's, I thought. Only to realize what an illusionist I was being.

I had to get my passport, I was in no hurry. Since, I was already aware of the grim situation of police verification in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, I decided to get my passport from Lucknow with some fakes of being in Lucknow like from forever. I was against my dad of having an agent 'help' us during this process of applying for the passport. However, I had to accept it, since it was my dad doing the orders here. The agent told<!-- more --> he would be charging Rs. 2500/- for applying the passport and we would have to bear any charges that came in the way of police verification and other inquiries. Usually that would be Rs. 500 for the L.I.U verification and Rs. 500 for the police verification, he told us. I had heard stories of my friends getting there passport's without any bribe being given and thereby I thought what a fool we were being while doing this.

The passport was applied for. The L.I.U. guy came after a month and after he did the entire inquiry he had to, my dad slipped Rs. 500 in his pocket and asked politely to be quick in moving the necessary files to the police for the entire verification. He told that would happen the next day. Yes, he kept his words and called us to inform the same.

This time, my dad asked me to go to the police station and do the remaining on my own. He told me take Rs. 500 from mom while going there. I thought forget it, I am never gonna give him any money in any case. After all, I am an aware and responsible citizen of this country who is against corruption. In the police station, one "Pandey ji" greeted me politely enough and checked my application in a file. Some applications were as old as 3-4 months and had been lying there untouched, dusty. He gave me a form to fill and told me that work would be done as soon as possible. I was happy. At last some one did not accept a bribe on the way. I began to leave. He told me, "File aage nai badh paaegi". I got the hint. I opened up wallet to offer him Rs.500. He said, "Bhot galat kar rahe hain aap..itne mein hume kuch nai milega..teen logon ke signature hote hain yahan". wtf, I thought. I pleaded him to do away with that. He was stern. Had to offer him another hundred buck to leave the bastard satisfied. The entire time, there was a fear in his attitude that someone might be watching. I had to give in, after all I had to get this thing done.

That was just me, other people having there applications lying in that file will be coming back to him to get their work done. The corruption at the grass-root level SHOULD NOT be eliminated. In case it is, the work that is supposed to take just a couple of days will be taking some months to finish. No matter what you do Anna Hazare or Baba Ramdev, corruption SHOULD prevail. All hail corruption.
